# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage is used as a container where I could write up and store lessons that I have learned throughout the prework study. The project is my first gateway to the web-development world, and so it may not be a standout webpage. However, It will remain to be the stepping stone for my journey in the industry; I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub, JavaScript, SSH keys, and Command Line Interface. Additionally, I learned the importance of developing a Growth mindset, and the web development process while building this project .  I will keep improving it as I learn more concepts during my bootcamp stay and beyond in order to add more features for its better implementation in the future .
I used resources from google, and re-read the study modules to solve some challenges I encoutered over the course of developing this project.
